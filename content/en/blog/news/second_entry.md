## NodeBase Devs tools released!

I am releasing the initial nodebase tools package. You can learn more about it and how to download it in [Tools](/docs/tools).
This package contains the sentry node setup and a few useful 
scripts to assist in the setup.

If you are interested in setting up a relay node, have a look at [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) with all details on setting this. Some of the scripts in the tools are helpful when setting up a sentry node.

Addtional info on validator setup will be added as well.

There will be an easy to follow step-by-step guide on setting up a relay available shortly in the [Tutorial](/docs/tuturial) section.
