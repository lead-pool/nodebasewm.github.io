## NodeBaseDevs is introducing **ayaview**

Ayaview is a console based app to monitor your node,  showing on-chain activity and system metrics.
This tool can be used from within a terminal.
It's light-weight on resource usage, since its not using any heavy database behind to store state or use monitoring services. 
It's fully configurable to monitor the validator node you are interested, and works on any cosmos-sdk based blockchain.



Here's a live demo of a Sentry Node spinning up and playing catch-up to get synced to the current blockheight.
You can see its getting blocks it doesnt have stored yet. 

Normal activity when its caught up, will be show thew new blocks
which appear around every 5s.
