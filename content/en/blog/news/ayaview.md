## NodeBaseDevs is introducing **ayaview**

Ayaview is a console based app to monitor your aya node,  it will  on-chain activity and system metrics.
It's very light-weight, doesn't comsume any resources, since it is not dependent on backend storages, like databases
to store blockchain history. Hence the application will only be monitoring the current blockchain state.
It's fully configurable to monitor any validator node on any cosmos chain you are interested in.## Ayaview Demo!


Here's a live demo of a Sentry Node spinning up and playing catch-up to get synced to the current blockHeight.
It's very fast syncing all blocks it has missed since it went down. As soon as it is caught up, normal activity
will assume with new blocks getting minted every 5s.
