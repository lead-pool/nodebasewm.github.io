## NodeBase Devs site is born!

Welcome to the **Nodebase developers** site. A place where we can share useful resources for Earthnode Operators
of the WorldMobile Chain.

This page was started to share material with the EarthNode community.As a early tester of WM Testnet [@earthnodechile](https://twitter.com/earthnodechile) has early insights in how testnet is doing and came to the conclusion a lot of tooling is needed to help setup, run and monitor your EarthNode.

On this site I will also publish material about Cosmos SDK and write step-by-step guides all things related to running an Earthnode.

Progress and opinion pieces on WM Testnet will be published to the blog section.

The documentation section will contain material about running an earthnode and in-house developed tools to
assist Earthnode operators. More on that in the next blog.
