## NodeBase Devs site is born!

Welcome to the **Nodebase developers** site. A place where we can share useful resources for Earthnode Operators
of the WorldMobile Chain.

Since ** ([@earthnodechile](https://twitter.com/earthnodechile)) **is part of the private testnet team of the WM Chain, I will share my unique insights on
testnet development, publish material about Cosmos SDK and write step-by-step guides all things related to
running an Earthnode.

Progress and opinion pieces on WM Testnet will be published to the blog section.

The documentation section will contain material about running an earthnode and in-house developed tools to
assist Earthnode operators. More on that in the next blog.
