  Installation instructions for sentry nodes

# Sentry Node installation  

Sentry Nodes dont have operator keys, since they are not part of the consensus.
The standard install_node.sh script on public testnet does not support sentry node installation

An install script can be downloaded from this location **[download git](https://github.com/nodebasewm/download)**

You can follow the Sentry Validator configuration instructions to configure your nodes accordingly after
installation completes.
