&lt;p>This is write up of my chat with Zac. Obviously they can&amp;rsquo;t share anything that isn&amp;rsquo;t in the public domain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Catching up with &lt;strong>Zac and Ryan&lt;/strong>, as you all know, the great and the good of crypto have been in Dubai in early Feb
for the Satoshi Roundtable. I’ll just have to assume that my invitation got lost in the post!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Undeterred, I jetted off to Dubai for some winter sun and golf but couldn’t resist reaching out to the World Mobile Team
as I never like missing out on an opportunity to meet up.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-meetup">The Meetup&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Despite having a packed timetable, our very own Head of Tokens Zac and Ryan agreed to meet me over a coffee for a
quick catch up. They were both fresh from attending the Roundtable the previous day so my first question was about
the “through the roof” interest in World Mobile”. Naturally neither could talk to me about specifics but they spoke
enthusiastically about the number of people wanting to speak to World Mobile about potential projects.
When I consider the amount of influence gathered for this conference I can understand why the team would be excited.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the course of the next hour we chatted about a wide range of topics all of which various teams within World Mobile
are working on. Obviously Zac and Ryan couldn’t provide me with anything that isn’t already in the public domain so
some of the comments below are my take on things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Saturation - the team have listened to the concerns of the community and recognise that the current saturation is
probably on the high side. My expectation is that this will be reduced but nor is it going to be on the very low side.
The focus is very much on having as many nodes as possible deployed delivering a quality service rather than a few highly
saturated ones. To this end Zac mentioned a number of solutions he was looking into to make the setting up of nodes as simple
as possible which was music to my ears.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="rewards-paper-2">Rewards Paper 2&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>lots of work has been done in this area looking at different reward models. I have heard lots of speculation from the community
on when this is likely to come out and what it will look like. Following my chat, my take on this is that it will be
issued sooner rather than later.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="asia">Asia&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Asia - nothing really new here and as Mr T mentioned in Spaces, we are likely to hear soon. World Mobile have been
approached by a number of countries in the region so it’s a case of sitting tight to hear more.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="balloons">Balloons&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Aerostat - do you really think I asked?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="testnet">Testnet&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Testnet Roll-out - we know the answer to that.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="final-words">Final Words&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>My overall impression following the meeting remains unchanged and I’m as positive, if not more so that as ENOs we are
part of something really exciting. World Mobile are working on a large number of tandem running projects being pulled together
to create the ecosystem to make this a success.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The component parts are ever changing and evolving and the team are having to pivot quickly to meet the roadmap and demands of the World Mobile community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are inevitable bumps in the road and I know people will argue that some could have been foreseen but I think there are many that could never have been anticipated.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
